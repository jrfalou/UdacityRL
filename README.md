# Repo for Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

## Intro
This repository contains a summary of my work towards graduating from the Udacity's Deep RL Nanodegree. It is structured based on the degree's syllabus and addresses different methods used to solve Reinforcement Learning problems:
- DQN (Deep Q-Learning) 
  - implemented and calibrated while solving the OpenAI Gym environement "Lunar-Lander"
  - used to solved the degree's first project, labelled "Navigation"

## Dependencies
The content of this repository is heavily dependent on the below git repos:
- Udacity Deep RL Nanodegree (add link)
- OpenAI Gym project (add link)
- Unity (add link)

## Installation
conda create --name myuda python=3.6
activate myuda
pip install unityagents
conda install -c pytorch pytorch

## DQN algo
