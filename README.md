# Repo for Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

## Intro
This repository contains a summary of my work towards graduating from the Udacity's Deep RL Nanodegree. It is structured based on the degree's syllabus and addresses different methods used to solve Reinforcement Learning problems:
- DQN (Deep Q-Learning) 
  - implemented and calibrated while solving the OpenAI Gym environement "Lunar-Lander"
  - used to solved the degree's first project, labelled "Navigation"

## Dependencies
