# Repo for Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree

## Intro
This repository is destined to contain a summary of my work towards graduating from the Udacity's Deep RL Nanodegree. It will be structured based on the degree's syllabus and will addresse different methods used to solve Reinforcement Learning problems:

Right now, the only algorithm available is the DQN algo:
- DQN (Deep Q-Learning) 
  - I implemented and calibrated my algo while solving the OpenAI Gym environement "Lunar-Lander" (note that it's heavily inspiraed by the implementation presented in the course)
  - I used it to solve the degree's first project, labelled "Navigation"

## Dependencies
The content of this repository will be heavily dependent on the below git repos:
- Udacity Deep RL Nanodegree (add link)
- OpenAI Gym project (add link)
- Unity (add link)

## Installation
conda create --name myuda python=3.6  
activate myuda  
pip install unityagents  
conda install -c pytorch pytorch  

## DQN algo
### Setup the training environment
If not already done, follow the installation steps (add link) 
### Implementation and calibration
### Udacity Navigation project
